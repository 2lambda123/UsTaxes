# Running

This application can be either run as a web application or a standalone desktop application. 

### Web application

To run, `npm start` or `yarn start`.

### Desktop application

To run, `npm run desktop` or `yarn run desktop`. This requires [rust and cargo][Cargo-docs] to be available on PATH. To avoid a browser window being spawned in addition to the desktop window, just set the BROWSER environment variable as in: `BROWSER=none npm run desktop` or `BROWSER=none yarn desktop`.

To release, run `npm run desktop-release` or `yarn desktop-release`. This will produce executables for your current environment.
